# Cardiotocography

School project on the prediction of fetal problem with cardiotocographe data. 
It's a **classification problem** of three class where we try to predict whether or not the **fetus** has a problem based of :

+ uterin contraction of the mother 
+ the hertbeat of the fetus

The notebook shows the resolution of the problem with a **AutoML** tool named H2O step by step
