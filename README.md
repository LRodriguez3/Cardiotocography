# Cardiotocography

School project on the prediction of fetal problem with cardiotocographe data. 
It's a **classification problem** of three class where we try to predict whether or not the **fetus** has a problem based of :

+ uterin contraction of the mother 
+ the hertbeat of the fetus

The notebook shows the resolution of the problem with a *AutoML* tool named **TPOT**. Then we try to have a better result of the TPOT model by working on the data and by searching for the best model manually.

The goal is to see the added value of the expertise of a data scientist here.

Later on, a coupling-based method is tested by coupling the result of the prediction of each of the target.
